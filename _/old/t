We describe the process asymetrically but both side behave the same : 
- BNF1 selects a relatively recent relatively sparce tsBf x. 
- BNF1 selects a set bit x[b] from x.
- BNF1 asks BNF2 if it knows any y with y[b] set and
  y.timestamp near/after x.timestamp.
...
Actually I need to think about this more, but 


- If yes they employ a symetric difference algorithm to consolodate,
  possibly reverting to a no path . 
- If no, 

BNF2 says yes, then BNF2 try to widdle down 

- BNF2 replies either yes, 

- If BNF2 says no, then BNF1 tries another x from the beginning.
- If BNF2 says yes, then BNF2 ...
