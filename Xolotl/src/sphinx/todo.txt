TESTS !!!!


Keys
- Make keys GNUnet compatable using features

Extend client side
- Transaction???
- Converion from instructions into commands
- SURB beta insertion?
- Commands after SURB beta?
- Abstractions for instruction length?
- Basic TESTS !!!!

Client API
- Reference structs
- Store SURBS
- Actual API

SURBs
- Consistent beta lengths in both implementaiton and paper
  - Padding
  - Allowed list
- Add foreign SURB unwinding based on ../../papers/add.txt
  - Maybe start SURB unwinding based on alpha
- unimplemented!() bits
- TESTS with SURBs
- Cross protocol unwinding?
  - Trait objects vs recursion?

Improve data model:
- Improve indexing client's foreign ratchets by node
- SURB storage
  - Remove Arcs?
- Queues and Mailboxes
  - Remove Arcs?

All those unimplemented!()

All those TODOs

Write Cuckoo filter

Params
- Pass params as if it were data.
- Move to mod.rs perhaps?

Commands
- Add Command::Delete
- Add support for multiple commands without decryption
  - Add Command::DropOff
    - Support both surb_keys and bodies in same message
- Add Command::??
- Explain why `Command` needs two paramaters instead of a single
  uninhabited type with associated types.  Simplicity.

Ratchet
- Berry depends on beta in both implementation and paper
- Return chacha.nonce too!


COFU
- New repository
- tex
  - Add Protocol 1
  - Add strawman maybe?
- Fix Zaki's BLS signatures 
- Implement !!!
