TESTS !!!!


Keys
- Abstract keys into a top level model
- Make keys into GNUnet compatable

Extend client side
- Basic TESTS !!!!
- Converion from instructions into commands

Client API
- Reference structs
- Store SURBS
- Actual API

SURBs
- Start SURB unwinding based on alpha
- unimplemented!() bits
- TESTS with SURBs
- Cross protocol unwinding?
  - Trait objects vs recursion?

Improve data model:
- Indexing client's foreign ratchets by node
- SURB storage
  - Remove Arcs?
- Queues and Mailboxes
  - Remove Arcs?

All those unimplemented!()

All those TODOs

Write Cuckoo filter

Params
- Pass params as if it were data.
- Move to mod.rs perhaps?

Commands
- Add Command::DropOff
- Add Command::Delete
- Add Command::??
- Explain why `Command` needs two paramaters instead of a single
  uninhabited type with associated types.  Simplicity.
