\subsection{Contact points}

We stated in \S\ref{subsec:crossover} that SURBs might be supplied
by either the sender or the cross over point itself.  We refer to 
a cross over point that supplies the SURB as a {\em contact point}.
We divide contact points acording to the issues they address,
as determined by how they authorize the sender,

We observed in \S\ref{subsec:challenges}, and shall discuss more in
the next section, that mix node keys must rotate for forward secrecy,
but that doing so limits SURB lifetimes.  As a result, clients would
only posses SURBs for contacts they have corresponded with recently.
We cannot even propose that clients message all their contacts within
each key epoch clients may go offline for extended periods.

Instead, we need contact points that restrict the senders to existing
contacts of the recipient.  Recipients can simply inform all their
senders about these contact points and keep the supply of SURBs held
by those contact points updated.  These contact points require
authentication credentials to be provided in the command they extract
from $\beta$.  Recipients must communicate the authentication
credentials required by their contact points to their senders of course.
We note that recipients should still provide senders with SURBs so
that frequent senders do not exaust the SURBs held by contact points,
as well as for faster communications with frequent contacts.

We could deploy many different authentication credentials ranging 
from single-use tokens as in \cite{agl-pond-hmac}, or
 group signatures~\cite{BBS,VLR}, to a simple shared secret.

We think VLR group signatures \cite{VLR} provide an interesting
option for two reasons.  Firstly, SURBs already provide a single-use
token scheme, so a multi-use scheme complements them nicely.  
Secondly, distinct group member private keys could be printed onto
ordinary buisness cards in advance and even the initial message
identifies the card carrying that member privte key.  Identities
can be assigned to these keys after communication is established.  
Importantly sendrs can be revoked without invalidating all existing
keys.  We expect VLR group signatures incur notable computational
overhead for the contact point.  % Worse, this cost grows as more
% senders get revoked and revokations are surprisingly frequent in
% practice \cite{agl-pond-hmac}.
% TODO: Verify that VLR groups signatures scale badly in revokations

As a rule, contact points are an extremely low bandwidth channel
since their stuply of SURBs can easily be exausted.  We must not
reveal any identifying information about the sender to the contact 
point itself during authentication, but authentication should ideally
reveal some $\iota$ to the contact point from which the recipient
can identify the sender.  VLR group signatures and single-use tokens
provide this $\iota$, but a simple shared secret fails to.  We must
now communicate $\iota$ from the contact point to the recipient. 
We could encode $\iota$ into the SURB log, or even empty space in
$\delta$, but this poses two minor problems: 
 Another hop could corrupt $\iota$ masking the true sender.
 Also $\iota$ is large for VLR group signatures.  
%TODO: Verify that $\iota$ is large for VLR group signatures.
We could accumulate a log of $\iota$s on the contact point and send
this log to the recipient when few SURBs reman, but this only
provides verification after the fact.

%TODO: Talk about if we're implementing VLR group signatures?
%TODO: Explain why we cannot simply move the contact points under DoS.


\subsection{New contacts}

We do want special contact points called {\em greeting points} that
do not restrict senders to existing contacts.  A priori, these sound
vulnerable to denal-of-service attacks, and might suffer from SPAM.
We hope that simply moving the advertised greeting points frequently
works, so long as existing contacts never need them thanks to other
contact points.

We need a facility for users to indroduce other users to one another.
because doing so seems essental for group communication.  If Alice 
knows both Bob and Carol then Alice can introduce Bob and Carol by
providing each with either a SURB if the introduction should happen
in a timely fashion, or with authentication credentials for each
others' contact points.  

We require that Alice does not compramise her ability to contact
either Bob or Carol by doing the introduction and that Bob and Carol
can each distinguish the others' messages' from Alice. 
Alice can share single-use token from Bob and Carol of course.
In a VLR scheme, Alice creates the dilivery authorization signature
that Bob and Carol must use.
Also, we recall that $\delta$ must be encrypted at the cross over
point, so Alice can supply Bob and Carol with authentication tokens 
that must live inside $\delta$ and that require verification before
fully decrypting $\delta$.
