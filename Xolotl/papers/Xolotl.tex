\begin{abstract}
We describe a new double ratchet construction Xolotl, inspired by the
Axolotl ratchet, that integrates with the Sphinx mix network packet
format.  We argue this opens the door to compact mix network formats
with stronger forward secrecy and truly hybrid anonymity, meaning they
rest upon the stronger of the security assumptions required by the
different public key primitives employed.

We also describe an onion encrypted ``log'' that allows messages to
be routed by several single-use reply blocks (SURBs) before being
unwrapped by the receiver.  This gives us a request-and-forward
architecture with privacy for both the sender and recipient,
increases reliability, and simplifies several protocol enhancements.

\subsection{Analysis}

We take $r$ to be 256 bits so that, assuming the initial ratchet
source was created using a post-quantum key exchange, then our
Xolotl ratchet provides 128 bits of post-quantum security.

In addition, Xolotl provides a measure of forward secrecy against
a classical adversary in that the symmetric key information $r$,
$\ck_j$ for $j<j'$, $\lk_{j'}$, and $s'$ all gets erased when
the packet gets queued.  An adversary who later compromises the
private key of our node $n_i$ learns the next hop only for packets
that did not employ any ratchet at $n_i$.

For these advantages, we have exposed,
 to the node $n_i$ hosting the ratchet, that all packets using this
particular ratchet were directed by the same party, making that
party either the sender or receiver if the packet is a SURB.

We expect Xolotl ratchets to be more reliable than fs-mixes because
the hash iteration ratchet component permits ratchet reuse even when
packets get dropped or delayed.  There is a corresponding cost in
that we reveal a connection between far more packets to the node
$n_i$ hosting the ratchet.

There is no need for every hop to employ a ratchet, % though, 
but specific usage patterns require detailed analysis.

\[ \begin{aligned}
\textrm{User} \to &\textrm{Tor} \to \textrm{Xolotl} \to \textrm{Sphinx} \to \\
\quad &\to \textrm{Xolotl} \to \textrm{Sphinx} \to \textrm{Cross} \to \cdots 
\end{aligned} \]

If ratchets are used at only certain hops, then the mix learns
information about its role and position in the route.  
We could mitigate this by consolidating ratchets on specified mix
nodes, presumably with more storage and/or hardened hosting, but
this doing so concentrates our forward secrecy and post-quantum 
defenses as well.

In Tor, there is a more restrictive procedure for selecting the
first hop in a circuit, called a {\it guard} node.  We expect
mix networks will benefit from specialized guard selection as well.
Assuming mix nodes can easily distinguish clients from mix nodes,
there is no need for a ratchet at guard node because the client and
the mix node should use a conventional ephemeral key exchange,
likely a hybrid of an elliptic curve and post-quantum key exchange.

An initial set of ``guard'' ratchets could be created anew for each
session, possibly distinct from the client's actual guard nodes.

We believe that retaining middle ratchets for longer periods could
improve forward secrecy over creating them all anew with each session. 
There are many concerns around this point however, primarily balancing
the improved forward secrecy with the risk of linking packets across
different sessions, but also
 practical matters like ratchet storage requirements on mix nodes.  

Ratchet key material does not expire with node keys.  Indeed, even
berry keys may outlive node keys because the sender simply remembers
them.  We may therefore set ratchet key expiration based upon storage
concerns.

\section{Performance evaluation}

Using Bloom filter, how much storage per message?
Give resulting key rotation frequencies for realistic
scenarios. (all calculated)

Bandwidth overhead (ok to do mathematically, but precise,
in bytes).  Computational overhead (measured).

Expected latency by pool strategy. (simulated or calculated)
% We might ignore that and defer to Loopix paper

Messages per second on realistic hardware. (calculated from
microbenchmarks is sufficient)

Required replication level for different reliability assumptions.
Assume different reliabilities for ordinary mixes vs. aggregators
(aggregation points are picked based on known reliability).  How high
does availability need to be to keep replication reasonably low?
(calculated)

Total (system-wide) financial cost per message including reliability
for 99.9999\% availability under realistic assumptions about node
availability. (Assume Amazon EC2 compute node profile for availability
and cost on the one hand, and say a Raspberry Pi at home with typical
DSL-like network (un)availability with Indian-style power outages on
the other)

Discussion on use of Taler to pay for service.
% Riseup/LEAP version viable. 
% Paying aggregation points might be viable. 
% Paying mixes in obnoxious due to overhead. 


\section{Improvements}

We expect that a malicious mix node hosting a Xolotl ratchet learns
that all packets using the ratchet were directed by the same party,
either the sender or receiver.  Considering the modest delay created
by mixes, this allows a weak correlation to be made between ratchet
use and the respective client being online.

A simple counter-measure would be support for a delay mode where
clients can flag messages to be artificially delayed by mixes beyond
the usual delay for mixing.  This could be used to create messages
that traverse the client's ratchet at times where they have been
offline for a while, thereby reducing the correlation between ratchet
use and the client being online.

Another mitigation strategy would be for clients
to share particular ratchet configurations with other nodes.
If several link keys from the same branch can be shared anonymously,
then the sharer risks nothing in doing so, assuming pre-image
resistance for our hash function.  Thus, another way of destroying the
link between ratchet use and user being online would be to share a
batch of link keys from the same branch with a mix node so that it
could utilize our ratchet for messages it needed to send anyways.
However, this assumes mix nodes send numerous messages over the mix
network, which our design currently does not require.

We observe that anyone using this shared link key could gain a berry
key that only they know, along with the mix node hosting the ratchet,
thus allowing them to create a whole new branch.  It follows that,
if individual shared link keys can be retrieved anonymously, then
the recipient of the shared link key risks only that the key fails.
Thus, this creates a minor problem in the form of denial of service
attack against the receiver of such a shared ratchet.

In practice, we cannot provide perfect anonymity in either sharing or
retrieving shared link keys, and retrieving lone link keys sounds
problematic.  Yet, there may be an opportunity here for a second
anonymity system that communicates these shared link keys.
% FIXME: not sure I understand ``lone link keys'' here.

\section{}







Anonymous messaging proposals have traditionally either avoided
request-and-forward facilities, due to metadata leakage \cite{??},
or addressed it using private information retrieval (PIR) schemes
\cite{??}.  These PIR schemes increase complexity, invoke disparate
security analysis techniques, and still leak considerable metadata.
