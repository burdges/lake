A quantum computer factored 15 without cheating last year. \\
That might not sound like much progress for 20 years, but \\
\hspace*{3pt}  one should expect slow progress to continue, and \\
\hspace*{3pt}  one cannot expect negative results. \\

\medskip

We could worry for many decades even if they are impossible!

\begin{frame}{Post-quantum Sphinx?}

We have two seemingly post-quantum key exchanges :
\begin{itemize}
\item Ring learning with errors and
\item Super-singular isogenies Diffie Hellman 
\end{itemize}

\medskip
In both cases, we need a blinding operations presumably based on
 the key exchange operation, but..
\begin{itemize}
\item anonymity is far more delicate than cryptography,
\item blinding is more fragile than key exchange, 
\item fewer researchers will ever study blinding, ..
\end{itemize}

\smallskip

And blinding is weakened by using multiple systems!
