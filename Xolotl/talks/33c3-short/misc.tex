A mix network packet has a header, a SURB, and a body where
\begin{itemize}
\item the header is an onion of authenticated public-key exchanges,
\item the body is encrypted using a wide block cypher, \\
  but not authenticated, and
\item the Single-Use Reply Block (SURB) is a second header, \\
 \hspace*{2pt} providing recipient and two-way anonymity.
\end{itemize}
\[ \cdots \to S_{k-1} \to S_k \to \textrm{Cross} \to R_1 \to R_2 \to \cdots \]

\medskip

All usability properties are determined by how we handle SURBs.
