Can a recipient be anonymous? \\
Yes!  With a Single-Use Reply Block (SURB).

\medskip
An anonymous recipient must
\begin{itemize}
\item create the Sphinx header $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$, 
\item communicate it to the sender $n$ in advance, and 
\item remember symmetric keys since $\delta$ gets encrypted at each hop.
\end{itemize}

\bigskip
\bigskip
\pause
All keys are ephemeral in Sphinx to enable replay protection, \\
\hspace*{2pt} so SURBs have a limited lifetime.

\end{frame}


\begin{frame}{Bi-directional anonymity in Sphinx}
Can both parties be anonymous? \\
Yes!  With a cross-over point that violates wrap-resistance.

\medskip
We modify the protocol:
\begin{itemize}
\item Reserve twice the space for the Sphinx header. 
\item Onion encrypt and HMAC the extra space with the header.{\small $^*$}
\item Add a method to replace a header with this extra space. 
 and generate its extra space filler deterministically from a seed $s$. 
\end{itemize}
Now a SURB consists of \\
\hspace*{2pt} a starting node $n$, \ the seed $s$, \ and \\
\hspace*{2pt} our Sphinx header $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ valid from $n$.

\medskip
Use this SURB by building a Sphinx header to $n$ that \\
\hspace*{2pt} onion decrypts itself to $s$ and its extra space  to $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.

\bigskip\bigskip

{\small $^*$ We onion encrypt the Sphinx headers backwards, including those that use SURBs,
but the SURB itself must encrypt this extra space forwards.}

\begin{frame}{Tiered delivery strategies}
% Synchronous 
Quick replies :
If users share SURBs with one another, then \\ % {\small $^1$}
\hspace*{2pt} they send messages directly but only during one mixnet session.

\medskip

Mailbox accounts for asynchronous messages : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Created on a random mixnet relay $n$, \\
 \hspace*{2pt} assigned a mailbox id $m$ and a shared secret $k$.
\item Checked by supplying with quick reply SURBs
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\pause

Frequent contacts : Give SURBs for sending to primary mailbox %{\small $^2$}

\medskip

Infrequent or public contact options : 
\begin{itemize}
\item Give real delivery details for a secondary mail server
\item Could require tokens or group signatures, or proof-of-work
\item Form a tree of secondary mailboxes
\end{itemize}

% {\small $^1$ We could go even faster using HORNET-like circuits.}
% {\small $^2$ Add a short segment encrypted to communicate the identity of the SURB used to reach the mailbox }
