@inproceedings{Yin2009,
	Abstract = {Web 2.0 has led to the development and evolution of web-based communities and applications. These communities provide places for information sharing and collaboration. They also open the door for inappropriate online activities, such as harassment, in which some users post messages in a virtual community that are intentionally offensive to other members of the community. It is a new and challenging task to detect online harassment; currently few systems attempt to solve this problem. In this paper, we use a supervised learning approach for detecting harassment. Our technique employs content features, sentiment features, and contextual features of documents. The experimental results described herein show that our method achieves significant improvements over several baselines, including Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) approaches. Identification of online harassment is feasible when TFIDF is supplemented with sentiment and contextual feature attributes.},

@article{extratrees,
	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new tree-based ensemble method for supervised classification and regression problems. It essentially consists of randomizing strongly both attribute and cut-point choice while splitting a tree node. In the extreme case, it builds totally randomized trees whose structures are independent of the output values of the learning sample. The strength of the randomization can be tuned to problem specifics by the appropriate choice of a parameter. We evaluate the robustness of the default choice of this parameter, and we also provide insight on how to adjust it in particular situations. Besides accuracy, the main strength of the resulting algorithm is computational efficiency. A bias/variance analysis of the Extra-Trees algorithm is also provided as well as a geometrical and a kernel characterization of the models induced.},

@inproceedings{Lin2012,
	Abstract = {The success of data-driven solutions to difficult problems, along with the dropping costs of storing and processing mas- sive amounts of data, has led to growing interest in large-scale machine learning. This paper presents a case study of Twitters integration of machine learning tools into its existing Hadoop-based, Pig-centric analytics platform. We begin with an overview of this platform, which handles traditional data warehousing and business intelligence tasks for the organization. The core of this work lies in recent Pig extensions to provide predictive analytics capabilities that incorporate machine learning, focused specifically on super- vised classification. In particular, we have identified stochastic gradient descent techniques for online learning and ensemble methods as being highly amenable to scaling out to large amounts of data. In our deployed solution, common machine learning tasks such as data sampling, feature generation, training, and testing can be accomplished directly in Pig, via carefully crafted loaders, storage functions, and user-defined functions. This means that machine learning is just another Pig script, which allows seamless integration with existing infrastructure for data management, schedul- ing, and monitoring in a production environment, as well as access to rich libraries of user-defined functions and the materialized output of other scripts.},

	Abstract = {Dishonest behaviors in on-line networks include the problems caused by those actions performed by certain elements in a network in order to obtain some kind of benefits from the system. The analysis of this phenomenon concerns the WWW from two points of view: the Web as a collection of interrelated documents, and the social networks. In this work we study the web spam detection and the computation of trust and reputation in on-line social networks. We propose two graph-based ranking algorithms, based on different propagation models that spread the information from a set of elements in the network to compute the global relevance of all the nodes in the system. {\copyright} 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

	Abstract = {Abstract---Online social networks (OSNs) are becoming increasingly popular every day. The vast amount of data created by users and their actions yields interesting opportunities, both socially and economically. Unfortunately, these online communities are prone to abuse and inappropriate behaviour such as cyber bullying. For victims, this kind of behaviour can lead to depression and other severe problems. However, due to the huge amount of users and data it is impossible to manually check all content posted on the social network. We propose a pluggable architecture with reusable components, able to quickly detect harmful content. The platform uses text-, image, audio and video-based analysis modules to detect inappropriate content or high risk behaviour. Domain services aggregate this data and flag user profiles if necessary. Social network moderators need only check the validity of the flagged profiles. This paper reports upon key requirements of the platform, the architectural components and important challenges.},

@article{evans:2012,
	Abstract = {The size of a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is an important parameter for
performance tuning of P2P routing algorithms.  This paper introduces
and evaluates a new efficient method for participants in an
unstructured P2P network to establish the size of the overall network.
The presented method is highly efficient, propagating information
about the current size of the network to all participants using
O(|E|) operations where |E| is the number of edges in the network.
Afterwards, all nodes have the same network size estimate, which can
be made arbitrarily accurate by averaging results from multiple rounds
of the protocol.  Security measures are included which make it
prohibitively expensive for a typical active participating adversary
to significantly manipulate the estimates.  This paper includes
experimental results that demonstrate the viability, efficiency and
accuracy of the protocol.
